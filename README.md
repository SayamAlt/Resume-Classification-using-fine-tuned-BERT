# Resume-Classification-using-fine-tuned-BERT

## Project Scope

Classification of resumes into their respective jobs simplies things a lot at the corporate level, especially for the HR recruiters and hiring managers who otherwise have to look through each and every resume first just to identify the domain on which any specific resume is based. Automating the initial screening process in such a manner will enhance the overall quality and efficiency of recruitment.
